            <h2>Thats right, your favorite games getting a sequel</h2>
            <p>
                Lever Simulator is getting a sequel, we have thought long and hard about what we wanted this sequel to be,
                You see Lever Simulator by almost all measures is a perfect game, So how, we hear you asking, did we add anything of 
                notable value to the sequel,
                <h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>firstly we felt Lever Simulator lacked story, we have rectified this and added a whole bible of new story to Lever Simulator 2!</li>
                    <li>Additionally we have added a new PvE mode, "Buttons strike Back", we haven't figured out all the details yet, but I am fairly certain it will be a political
                        thriller and most likely be an allegory for Battle of Rorke's Drift from the anglo zulu war.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>NEW NUMBER: 4</b><br>
                    some may believe it to be against the spirit of the original Lever simulator, but do not fear, we have implemented 4 in a tasteful way that adds to the original
                    rather than ruining it.</li>
                    <li><b>BALANCE CHANGES</b><br>
                        2 has been nerfed and 1 has been buffed to encourage a more varied and creative play style
                    </li>
                    <li><b>NEW VEHICLE: Hoverbike</b><br>
                        this is an endgame vehicle that is crafted in the Mars forge, requiring a new resource "Zyphirium" abtained in the harsh lava filled wastelands of Zypher; and essence of light, obtained 
                        from the light goddess "prisma"
                    </li>
